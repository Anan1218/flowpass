    question: "How does the ScanPass system work?",
    answer: "Our ScanPass system allows you to skip regular lines at attractions by reserving specific time slots. Simply select your desired attraction and preferred time, and you'll receive a designated return window."
  },
  {
    question: "How many ScanPasses can I hold at once?",
    answer: "You can hold up to 3 ScanPasses at a time. Once you use your first ScanPass, you can book another one, allowing you to continuously maximize your experience throughout the day."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I modify my ScanPass reservations?",
    answer: "Yes, you can modify or cancel your ScanPass reservations through our mobile app or website, subject to availability. Changes can be made up until your scheduled time slot."
  },
  {
    question: "Are ScanPasses included with my ticket?",
    answer: "Yes, ScanPasses are included with all standard admission tickets at no additional cost. Premium pass holders may receive additional ScanPass benefits."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if I miss my ScanPass time window?",
    answer: "ScanPass return windows have a one-hour duration. If you miss your scheduled time window, your ScanPass will expire and you'll need to make a new reservation."
